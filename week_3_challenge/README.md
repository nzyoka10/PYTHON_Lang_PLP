## Weekly Code Challenge - Week 3

### Introduction
- This week's coding challenge focuses on basic control flows and functions. Two coding challenges are presented below:

###### 1. Large Power (Question 1)
Create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:

- Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent.
- Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent.
- Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False.

##### Task
- To create a function named `large_power()` that takes two parameters named base and exponent.
- If base raised to the exponent is greater than 5000, return True, otherwise return False.

###### 2. Divisible By Ten (Question 2)
Create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. Using this, we can complete this function in a few steps:

- Define the function header to accept one input num.
- Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus).
- Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False.

##### Task
- To create a function called `divisible_by_ten()` that has one parameter named num.

- The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise. Consider using modulo operator % to check for divisibility.
