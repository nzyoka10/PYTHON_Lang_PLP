Assignment operators
You can use assignment operators to assign values to a variable throughout the lifecycle of the variable. Here are some assignment operators you're likely to encounter as you're learning to build programs:

Operator	Example
    =	x = 2
    x now contains 2.
    
    +=	x += 2
    x incremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
    
    -=	x -= 2
    x decremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 0.
    
    /=	x /= 2
    x divided by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 1.
    
    *=	x *= 2
    x multiplied by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
