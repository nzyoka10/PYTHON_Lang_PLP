# File Handling Assignment

This assignment demonstrates file handling in Python through a script named `file_handling_assignment.py`. The script performs various tasks including file creation, reading, appending, and error handling.

## File Creation

The script creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w') and writes at least three lines of text to it, including a mix of strings and numbers.

## File Reading and Display

Enhanced the script to read the contents of "my_file.txt" and display them on the console.

## File Appending

Modified the script to open "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a') and append three additional lines of text to the existing content.

## Error Handling

Implemented error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and PermissionError.

## Usage

- To run the script, execute the following command:
```python

python file_handling_assignment.py

```

## Files

- `file_handling_assignment.py`: The Python script implementing file handling tasks.
- `my_file.txt`: The text file created and manipulated by the script.
