# PYTHON PROGRAMMING
# work with output
# The idea of a program is to do something or carry out a task. 
# In Python, we can use the print() function to display information on the screen.

# Syntax:
# print(expression)

# Example 1: Printing simple text message
# sum = 1 + 2
# print(sum)

#print("Show this in the console")

# PYTHON VARIABLES
# Variables are names given to data so that it can be stored and accessed later. They hold values which can change during runtime.
# below example makes a calculation and stores it in variables

''' 
sum = 1+ 2
# variable SUM store in variables the value of 3

difference = sum - 1 
# Variable DIFFERENCE store in variables the result of subtraction between SUM and 1

product = sum * 2 
# variable PRODUCT store in variables the result of multiplication between SUM and 2 

print(difference)
print(product)

# PYTHON ::  Data types
# A variable assumes a data type. 
# In above program, SUM gets the int data type
# Examples of data types in python

# NUMERIC type --> number, with or without decimals
#                          --> int, float, complex, 
# STRING   type --> sequence of characters (text), enclosed by single quotes ' ', or double quotes " ".
# BOOLEAN type --> True or False
# LIST     type --> ordered and changeable collection of items. It's like an array in other programming languages.
# DICTIONARY type --> DICTIONARY is collection of key-value pairs. It's like a list but more flexible.

planets_in_solar_system = 8 # int data type
print(planets_in_solar_system)
print(type(planets_in_solar_system))

distance_to_alpha_centauri = 4.367 #Â float, lightyears
print(distance_to_alpha_centauri)
print(type(distance_to_alpha_centauri))

is_python_awesome = True # boolean data type
print(is_python_awesome)
print(type(is_python_awesome))

shuttle_landed_on_the_moon = "Apollo 11" #string
print(shuttle_landed_on_the_moon)
print(type(shuttle_landed_on_the_moon))
