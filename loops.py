#  for --- loop

# * For example:
# names = ["Kenya", "United States", "China", "Tanzania", "Somalia"]

# for name in names:
#     print('\n', name)

# * For Loops : using Range
#   - The range() function returns a sequence of numbers. 
#   - It can take one, two or three arguments to define the range of values to generate. 

#  example
# welcome_msg = "Welcome to PLP"

# for i in range(5):                    # Loop will run 5 times
#     print('\n', welcome_msg)
    
# ** While Loops
#   - A while loop is used when we don't know how many times the loop needs to be repeated.

# Example:
# count = 0

# while count < 10:                        # This loop will continue until count becomes equal to 10
#     print("\n Count Value: ", count)       # Printing the value of count
#     count += 1                          # Increasing the value of count by 1 after each iteration
# print("\n\nLoop Ended")                # This message will be printed once the loop ends
